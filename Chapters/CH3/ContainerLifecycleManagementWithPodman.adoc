=== There is a rhel7 container image but not a rhel8 image.  Where is the rhel8 container image?

Try to search and find the RHEL8 base image by searching https://catalog.redhat.com/software/containers/explore/ using the "rhel8" search string.

image::rhel8.png[title="rhel8 search results"]

Of the search results returned, try to find a rhel8 *Scratch* image, one that includes only base RHEL8 software.
You will not find one.  Instead the images available include additional software or configuration The *rhel8/dotnet-31* image, for example, contains the .NET SDK and Runtime as well as standard RHEL8 packages.
This may not be what you are looking for, especially, if you want a "vanilla" or *Scratch* RHEL8 image.

Now, repeat your search using *ubi8*

image::ubi8.png[title="ubi8 container image"]

Starting with RHEL8, Red Hat creates and distributes RHEL container images as *Universal Base Images* or *ubi* images.
If you are looking for a "scratch" image that includes only the standard RHEL8 packages, then look for *ubi* instead of *rhel*.


=== How can you install additional packages using a ubi image?

Inspect first the `ubi.repo` file in the ubi8 image:

[source,bash]
----
[student@workstation ~]$ podman pull registry.access.redhat.com/ubi8
Trying to pull registry.access.redhat.com/ubi8...

[student@workstation ~]$ podman run registry.access.redhat.com/ubi8 cat /etc/redhat-release
Red Hat Enterprise Linux release 8.6 (Ootpa)

[student@workstation ~]$ podman run registry.access.redhat.com/ubi8 cat /etc/yum.repos.d/ubi.repo
[ubi-8-baseos-rpms]
name = Red Hat Universal Base Image 8 (RPMs) - BaseOS
baseurl = https://cdn-ubi.redhat.com/content/public/ubi/dist/ubi8/8/$basearch/baseos/os
enabled = 1
gpgkey = file:///etc/pki/rpm-gpg/RPM-GPG-KEY-redhat-release
gpgcheck = 1
----

One interesting and useful feature of ubi images is the ability to install additional software via *yum* without a Red Hat subscription.

Consider running this interactive shell to install *httpd* (apache):

[source,bash]
----
[student@workstation ~]$ podman run -it registry.access.redhat.com/ubi8 /bin/bash
[root@7a6899de957c /]# yum install httpd -y

_Works!_ Why? Open your browser to the *baseurl* given in the *ubi8.repo*.  You can insert the x86_64 arch for this example:

=== How are the ubi images created by Red Hat? Do we publish the ubi Containerfile?

The ubi images distributed by Red Hat are not built in the same way a developer may customize one to create a layered image for their application.
Instead, they are created using a tarball extracted from the root filesystem of kickstarted virtual machines.

A good explanation is given in http://crunchtools.com/ubi-build/

The contents of most base images are created with operating system installers. While many base images utilize a Dockerfile, it probably doesn’t provide what you’re looking for. There’s an underlying chicken and egg problem because without a package manager installed and configured, the step by step instructions of how every file is laid out on disk can’t be easily expressed in a Dockerfile.

=== How are the names autogenerated by podman determined ?

Names will be autogenerated for containers with the form adjective_famousperson

SEE the sourcecode: https://github.com/containers/podman/blob/main/vendor/github.com/docker/docker/pkg/namesgenerator/names-generator.go


[source,bash]

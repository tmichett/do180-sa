=== Why do I get permission denied building images after running su - (or sudo su -) ?

It is common for container build environments to run as a specific user.  Gitlab, for example, uses the `gitlab-runner` user when executing CI/CD jobs that include `buildah` or `podman build` commands.
Sometimes using different users can impact authentication when building container images.

Consider this example where the `devops` user on the `workstation` machine is used for building container images.

First, assume that as the `student` user, you have already logged into the registry `registry.redhat.io`:

[source,bash]
----
[student@workstation ~]$ podman login --get-login registry.redhat.io
rhn-support-ablum
----

Instead of building with the `student` user, the `devops` user will be executing the `podman build`.  Become the `devops` user and create a simple `Containerfile` that leverages the `uib8:latest` image from `registry.redhat.io`:

[source,bash]
----
[student@workstation ~]$ sudo su - devops

[devops@workstation ~]$  mkdir echo1

[devops@workstation ~]$ cd echo1/

[devops@workstation echo1]$ vim Containerfile

FROM registry.redhat.io/ubi8:latest
ENTRYPOINT ["/usr/bin/echo", "Hello World!"]
----


Now, try and build this:

[source,bash]
----
[devops@workstation echo1]$ podman build -t mytest:1.0 .
STEP 1/2: FROM registry.redhat.io/ubi8:latest
Trying to pull registry.redhat.io/ubi8:latest...
Error: error creating build container: initializing source docker://registry.redhat.io/ubi8:latest: unable to retrieve auth token: invalid username/password: unauthorized: Please login to the Red Hat Registry using your Customer Portal credentials. Further instructions can be found here: https://access.redhat.com/RegistryAuthentication
----

Logging into `registry.redhat.io` will satisfy the authentication requirements when working with `registry.redhat.io`.

[source,bash]
----
[devops@workstation ~]$ podman login -u rhn-support-ablum registry.redhat.io
Password:
Login Succeeded!
[devops@workstation ~]$
----

But, consider that the credentials are being cached in a surprising location.

From `man podman-login`:

[quote]
____
The default path for reading and writing credentials is `${XDG_RUNTIME_DIR}/containers/auth.json`
____

In our example here, the `auth.json` does not exist with this path:

[source,bash]
----
[devops@workstation ~]$ cat ${XDG_RUNTIME_DIR}/containers/auth.json
cat: /containers/auth.json: No such file or directory

[devops@workstation ~]$ echo ${XDG_RUNTIME_DIR}

[devops@workstation ~]$
----

Why? `${XDG_RUNTIME_DIR}` was not set.  This environment variable is set via `pam_systemd`:

From `man pam_systemd`:

[quote]
____
On login, this module — in conjunction with systemd-logind.service — ensures the following:

If it does not exist yet, the user runtime directory /run/user/$UID is either created or mounted as new "tmpfs" file system with quota applied, and its ownership changed to the user that is logging in.
____

In our case, `podman login` will write to `/tmp` specifically:

[source,bash]
----
[devops@workstation ~]$ ls /tmp/podman-run-1001/containers/auth.json
/tmp/podman-run-1001/containers/auth.json
----

Therefore, for a build environment, a better strategy would be to leverage an authfile, one that uses a service account ( https://access.redhat.com/terms-based-registry/ )

First login into  https://access.redhat.com/terms-based-registry/ and navigate to your service account.

Click on the tab *Docker Configuration*:

image::docker-config.png[]

Click *view its contents*.  You will see the authfile contents in your browser.  Paste those into `~/.docker/config.json`:

[source,bash]
----
[devops@workstation ~]$ podman logout registry.redhat.io
[devops@workstation ~]$ mkdir ~/.docker
[devops@workstation ~]$ vim ~/.docker/config.json
{
  "auths": {
    "registry.redhat.io": {
      "auth": "MTk.......SNIP......Q=="
    }
  }
}

----

Building should now be successful without needing to run `podman login` beforehand.

[source,bash]
----
[devops@workstation ~]$ cd echo1/

[devops@workstation echo1]$ podman build -t mytest:1.0 .
STEP 1/2: FROM registry.redhat.io/ubi8:latest
Trying to pull registry.redhat.io/ubi8:latest...
...SNIP...

STEP 2/2: ENTRYPOINT ["/usr/bin/echo", "Hello World!"]
COMMIT mytest:1.0

558683ae8b33168e0b10a4abb79245aedee8e6e4c3c317099c37d454945365b3

[devops@workstation echo1]$ podman run mytest:1.0
Hello World!
----

Alternatively you can leverage the `--authfile` option to specify a different path as required by your build environment.
The contents of this file are the same as the `config.json` provided by the Customer Portal service account.

[source,bash]
----
[devops@workstation echo1]$ podman build -t mytest:1.0 --authfile ~/.docker/config.json .
STEP 1/2: FROM registry.redhat.io/ubi8:latest
Trying to pull registry.redhat.io/ubi8:latest...
...SNIP...
